# Flappy Robin

Flappy Robi is a flappy bird clone created with javascript using Cocos2dJS.  It was originally created by Bluefever Software a part of their Cocos2dJS videotutorials set. For some reason they only provide the code in downloadable .zip format.

That's why I've created this GIT repository to increase this code's visibility and encourage the community to fork it and add more features.
